# Android Kotlin Compose: Codelabs Collection 🚀

Welcome to my comprehensive collection of projects built following the **Google Android Developer Codelabs**. This repository serves as a personal knowledge base and a showcase of modern Android development practices using **Kotlin** and **Jetpack Compose**.

## 🛠 Tech Stack & Concepts

Across these projects, I implement and practice the following core Android concepts:

* **UI Framework:** Jetpack Compose (Declarative UI)
* **Language:** Kotlin (Coroutines, StateFlow, Serialization)
* **Architecture:** MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel), Repository Pattern
* **Navigation:** Compose Navigation component
* **Data:** Room Database, Retrofit (REST APIs), DataStore
* **State Management:** `remember`, `mutableStateOf`, ViewModel `StateFlow`

| Project | Description | Key Learning Points | Codelab Link |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Dice Roller** | A simple interactive app that rolls a virtual dice. | State management, `remember`, Button & Image composables. | [Link](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-compose-build-a-dice-roller-app) |
| **Lemonade App** | A multi-step interactive app with conditional logic. | Handling UI state transitions and click logic. | [Link](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://developer.android.com/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-compose-lemonade-app) |
| **Tip Calculator** | An app to calculate tips based on user input. | State hoisting, TextField, and keyboard actions. | [Link](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-compose-calculate-tip) |
| **Affirmations** | A scrollable list displaying text and images. | Working with `LazyColumn` and Card components. | [Link](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://developer.android.com/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-compose-training-add-images-and-animations) |

## 🚀 How to Run These Projects

1. **Clone the Repo:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/your-repo-name.git

```


2. **Open in Android Studio:**
* Open Android Studio (Ladybug or newer recommended).
* Select **File > Open** and navigate to the specific project folder (e.g., `/DiceRoller`).


3. **Build & Run:**
* Let Gradle sync finish.
* Select a physical device or emulator and click **Run** (the green play button).

## 🧠 Key Principles Remembered

Every project in this repo adheres to the "Modern Android Development" (MAD) scorecard:

* **Declarative UI:** No more XML; the UI is a function of the state.
* **State Hoisting:** Moving state to a caller to make composables stateless and easier to test.
* **Unidirectional Data Flow:** Events flow up, state flows down.

## 📈 Roadmap

* [ ] Complete Unit 3: Display lists and use Material Design.
* [ ] Complete Unit 4: Navigation and Architecture.
* [ ] Add Unit 5: Connect to the internet (Retrofit).
* [ ] Add Unit 6: Data persistence (Room).
